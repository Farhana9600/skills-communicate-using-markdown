# 🔁 C Program to Swap Two Numbers

This program swaps the values of two variables using a temporary variable.

---

## 📄 Code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a, b, temp;

    // Input two numbers
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%d", &a);
    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%d", &b);

    // Swapping logic
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;

    // Output the result
    printf("After swapping:\n");
    printf("First number = %d\n", a);
    printf("Second number = %d\n", b);

    return 0;
}
